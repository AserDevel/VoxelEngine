**Todo**
* Fix the camera floating point issue
* Add an entity class and a player class
* Add collision detection and physics
* Add better world generation
* Add transparency to water
* Add light emitting materials

**Ideas**
* dynamic objects with physics and rotation and custom size voxels (could include trees, grass and other high details objects)
* integer vector
* clouds and floating islands
* textures to voxels
* LOD for far away chunks to improve render distance
